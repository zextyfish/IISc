- [ ] To Create a sample holder
**Problem**: The current sample holder can only hold 3 samples, thus reducing the throughput of the setup.
Along with this, these guys are experiencing a problem of current holder buckling down due to the weight of the sample.

**Akshay's Solution**: A hexagonal sample holder

Look for a technique for checking pressure variation
- Can be done by measuring pressure after 3d printing
- Maybe some simulation technique
